# Pomodoro Timer

## Description

This is a productivity application that implements [The Pomodoro Technique](http://cirillocompany.de/pages/pomodoro-technique). It's used to break time devoted to deep work into chunks called *pomodoros* that are separated by *breaks* in time.

## Instructions

A user can choose the length of pomodoros, the length of breaks, and the number of pomodoros to run in one sitting (Maximum set to 8). The default settings are set to 52 minutes for a pomodoro and 17 minutes for a break, which was a recommended setting found in this [Forbes article](http://www.forbes.com/sites/travisbradberry/2016/06/07/why-the-8-hour-workday-doesnt-work/)

The application will give a popup notification in the browser and an audible cue to indicate when a pomodoro or break has completed to alert the user when it's time to switch modes.
